```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = NA)
```

# Data loading

```{r librairies, cache = FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
load("d1.RData")
load("d2.RData")
load("d3.RData")

data_train_DF=rbind(d1,d2,d3)
rm(d1,d2,d3)
summary(data_train_DF)
```

There are $3503$ sites that are measured during $7$ months during $23$ years, which makes $563983$ records.

We first create a site variable by concatening Longitude and latitude
```{r createsite}
data_train_DF<-data_train_DF %>% 
  unite(col = site, c("lon","lat"),remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(site=str_replace(site,pattern = "-",replacement = "L")) %>% 
  mutate(site=str_replace(site,pattern = "_",replacement = "l"))

```


# Data formatting

## Binning
```{r}
u_baprim=c(-1,u_ba)
cut(0,u_baprim, labels=F)
cut(60000,u_baprim, labels=F)
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
